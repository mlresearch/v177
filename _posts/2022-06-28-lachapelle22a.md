abstract: This work introduces a novel principle we call disentanglement via mechanism
  sparsity regularization, which can be applied when the latent factors of interest
  depend sparsely on past latent factors and/or observed auxiliary variables. We propose
  a representation learning method that induces disentanglement by simultaneously
  learning the latent factors and the sparse causal graphical model that relates them.
  We develop a rigorous identifiability theory, building on recent nonlinear independent
  component analysis (ICA) results, that formalizes this principle and shows how the
  latent variables can be recovered up to permutation if one regularizes the latent
  mechanisms to be sparse and if some graph connectivity criterion is satisfied by
  the data generating process. As a special case of our framework, we show how one
  can leverage unknown-target interventions on the latent factors to disentangle them,
  thereby drawing further connections between ICA and causality. We propose a VAE-based
  method in which the latent mechanisms are learned and regularized via binary masks,
  and validate our theory by showing it learns disentangled representations in simulations.
