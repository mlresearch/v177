abstract: We consider the problem of learning the structure of a causal directed acyclic
  graph (DAG) model in the presence of latent variables. We define "latent factor
  causal models" (LFCMs) as a restriction on causal DAG models with latent variables,
  which are composed of clusters of observed variables that share the same latent
  parent and connections between these clusters given by edges pointing from the observed
  variables to latent variables. LFCMs are motivated by gene regulatory networks,
  where regulatory edges, corresponding to transcription factors, connect spatially
  clustered genes. We show identifiability results on this model and design a consistent
  three-stage algorithm that discovers clusters of observed nodes, a partial ordering
  over clusters, and finally, the entire structure over both observed and latent nodes.
  We evaluate our method in a synthetic setting, demonstrating its ability to almost
  perfectly recover the ground truth clustering even at relatively low sample sizes,
  as well as the ability to recover a significant number of the edges from observed
  variables to latent factors. Finally, we apply our method in a semi-synthetic setting
  to protein mass spectrometry data with a known ground truth network, and achieve
  almost perfect recovery of the ground truth variable clusters.
