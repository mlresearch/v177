abstract: We study the problem of learning classifiers that perform well across (known
  or unknown) groups of data. After observing that common worst-group-accuracy datasets
  suffer from substantial imbalances, we set out to compare state-of-the-art methods
  to simple balancing of classes and groups by either subsampling or reweighting data.
  Our results show that these data balancing baselines achieve state-of-the-art-accuracy,
  while being faster to train and requiring no additional hyper-parameters. Finally,
  we highlight that access to group information is most critical for model selection
  purposes, and not so much during training. All in all, our findings beg closer examination
  of both benchmarks and methods for future research in worst-group-accuracy optimization.
