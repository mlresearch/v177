abstract: We introduce Predictive State Propensity Subclassification (PSPS), a novel
  learning algorithm for causal inference from observational data. PSPS combines propensity
  and outcome models into one encompassing probabilistic framework, which can be jointly
  estimated using maximum likelihood or Bayesian inference. The methodology applies
  to both discrete and continuous treatments and can estimate unit-level and population-level
  average treatment effects. We describe the neural network architecture and its TensorFlow
  implementation for likelihood optimization. Finally we demonstrate via large-scale
  simulations that PSPS outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms â€“ both on bias for
  average treatment effects (ATEs) and RMSE for unit-level treatment effects (UTEs).
