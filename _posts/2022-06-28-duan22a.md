abstract: 'In order to test if a treatment is perceptibly different from a placebo
  in a randomized experiment with covariates, classical nonparametric tests based
  on ranks of observations/residuals have been employed (eg: by Rosenbaum), with finite-sample
  valid inference enabled via permutations. This paper proposes a different principle
  on which to base inference: if — with access to all covariates and outcomes, but
  without access to any treatment assignments — one can form a ranking of the subjects
  that is sufficiently nonrandom (eg: mostly treated followed by mostly control),
  then we can confidently conclude that there must be a treatment effect. Based on
  a more nuanced, quantifiable, version of this principle, we design an interactive
  test called i-bet: the analyst forms a single permutation of the subjects one element
  at a time, and at each step the analyst bets toy money on whether that subject was
  actually treated or not, and learns the truth immediately after. The wealth process
  forms a real-valued measure of evidence against the global causal null, and we may
  reject the null at level $\alpha$ if the wealth ever crosses $1/\alpha$. Apart from
  providing a fresh "game-theoretic" principle on which to base the causal conclusion,
  the i-bet has other statistical and computational benefits, for example (A) allowing
  a human to adaptively design the test statistic based on increasing amounts of data
  being revealed (along with any working causal models and prior knowledge), and (B)
  not requiring permutation resampling, instead noting that under the null, the wealth
  forms a nonnegative martingale, and the type-1 error control of the aforementioned
  decision rule follows from a tight inequality by Ville. Further, if the null is
  not rejected, new subjects can later be added and the test can be simply continued,
  without any corrections (unlike with permutation p-values). Numerical experiments
  demonstrate good power under various heterogeneous treatment effects. We first describe
  the i-bet test for two-sample comparisons with unpaired data, and then adapt it
  to paired data, multi-sample comparison, and sequential settings; these may be viewed
  as interactive martingale variants of the Wilcoxon, Kruskal-Wallis, and Friedman
  tests.'
