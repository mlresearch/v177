abstract: 'Recent advances in Reinforcement Learning have allowed automated agents
  (for short, agents) to achieve a high level of performance across a wide range of
  tasks, which when supplemented with human feedback has led to faster and more robust
  decision-making. The current literature, in large part, focuses on the human’s role
  during the learning phase:  human trainers possess a priori knowledge that could
  help an agent to accelerate its learning when the environment is not fully known.
  In this paper, we study an interactive reinforcement learning setting where the
  agent and the human have different sensory capabilities, disagreeing, therefore,
  on how they perceive the world (observed states) while sharing the same reward and
  transition functions. We show that agents are bound to learn sub-optimal policies
  if they do not take into account human advice, perhaps surprisingly, even when human’s
  decisions are less accurate than their own. We propose the counterfactual agent
  who proactively considers the intended actions of the human operator, and proves
  that this strategy dominates standard approaches regarding performance. Finally,
  we formulate a novel reinforcement learning task maximizing the performance of an
  autonomous system subject to a budget constraint over the available amount of human
  advice. '
