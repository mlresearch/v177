abstract: Datasets involving irregular occurrences of different types of events over
  the timeline are increasingly commonly available. Proximal graphical event models
  (PGEMs) are a recent graphical representation for modeling relationships between
  different event types in such datasets. Existing algorithms for learning PGEMs from
  event datasets perform poorly on the task of structure discovery, which is particularly
  important for causal inference since the underlying graph determines the effect
  of interventions. In this paper, we explore causal semantics in PGEMs and study
  process independencies implied by the graphical structure of the model. We introduce
  (conditional) process independence tests for causal PGEMs, deploying them using  variations
  of constraint-based structure discovery algorithms for Bayesian networks. Through
  experiments with synthetic and real datasets, we show that the proposed approaches
  are better at balancing precision and recall, demonstrating  improved F1 scores
  over state-of-the-art baselines.
