abstract: Causal discovery from observational data is a challenging task that can
  only be solved up to a set of equivalent solutions, called an equivalence class.
  Such classes, which are often large in size, encode uncertainties about the orientation
  of some edges in the causal graph. In this work, we propose a new set of assumptions
  that constrain possible causal relationships based on the nature of variables, thus
  circumscribing the equivalence class. Namely, we introduce typed directed acyclic
  graphs, in which variable types are used to determine the validity of causal relationships.
  We demonstrate, both theoretically and empirically, that the proposed assumptions
  can result in significant gains in the identification of the causal graph. We also
  propose causal discovery algorithms that make use of these assumptions and demonstrate
  their benefits on simulated and pseudo-real data.
