abstract: 'Consider the problem of determining the effect of a compound on a specific
  cell type. To answer this question, researchers traditionally need to run an experiment
  applying the drug of interest to that cell type. This approach is not scalable:
  given a large number of different actions (compounds) and a large number of different
  contexts (cell types), it is infeasible to run an experiment for every action-context
  pair. In such cases, one would ideally like to predict the outcome for every pair
  while only needing outcome data for a small _subset_ of pairs. This task, which
  we label "causal imputation", is a generalization of the causal transportability
  problem. To address this challenge, we extend the recently introduced _synthetic
  interventions_ (SI) estimator to handle more general data sparsity patterns. We
  prove that, under a latent factor model, our estimator provides valid estimates
  for the causal imputation task. We motivate this model by establishing a connection
  to the linear structural causal model literature. Finally, we consider the prominent
  CMAP dataset in predicting the effects of compounds on gene expression across cell
  types. We find that our estimator outperforms standard baselines, thus confirming
  its utility in biological applications. '
