abstract: Despite recent progress in reinforcement learning (RL), RL algorithms for
  exploration still remain an active area of research. Existing methods often focus
  on state-based metrics, which do not con-sider the underlying causal structures
  of the environment, and while recent research has begun to explore RL environments
  for causal learning, these environments primarily leverage causal information through
  causal inference or induction rather than exploration. In contrast, human children—some
  of the most proficient explorers—have been shown to use causal information to great
  benefit.In this work, we introduce a novel RL environment designed with a controllable
  causal structure, which allows us to evaluate exploration strategies used by both
  agents and children in a unified environment.  In addition, through experimentation
  on both computation models and children, we demonstrate that there are significant
  differences between information-gain optimal RL exploration in causal environments
  and the exploration of children in the same environments. We leverage this new insight
  to lay the groundwork for future research into efficient exploration and disambiguation
  of causal structures for RL algorithms.
