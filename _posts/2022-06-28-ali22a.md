abstract: 'We consider the problem of extracting semantic attributes, using only classification
  labels for supervision. For example, when learning to classify images of birds into
  species, we would like to observe the emergence of features used by zoologists to
  classify birds. To tackle this problem, we propose training a neural network with
  discrete features in the last layer, followed by two heads: a multi-layered perceptron
  (MLP) and a decision tree. The decision tree utilizes simple binary decision stumps,
  thus encouraging features to have semantic meaning. We present theoretical analysis,
  as well as a practical method for learning in the intersection of two hypothesis
  classes. Compared with various benchmarks, our results show an improved ability
  to extract a set of features highly correlated with a ground truth set of unseen
  attributes.'
