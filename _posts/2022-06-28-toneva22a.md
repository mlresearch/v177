abstract: 'To study information processing in the brain, neuroscientists manipulate
  experimental stimuli while recording participant brain activity. They can then use
  encoding models to find out which brain "zone" (e.g. which region of interest, volume
  pixel or electrophysiology sensor) is predicted from the stimulus properties. Given
  the assumptions underlying this setup, when stimulus properties are predictive of
  the activity in a zone, these properties are understood to cause activity in that
  zone.  In recent years, researchers have used neural networks to construct representations
  that capture the diverse properties of complex stimuli, such as natural language
  or natural images. Encoding models built using these high-dimensional representations
  are often able to significantly predict the activity in large swathes of cortex,
  suggesting that the activity in all these brain zones is caused by stimulus properties
  captured in the representation. It is then natural to ask: "Is the activity in these
  different brain zones caused by the stimulus properties in the same way?" In neuroscientific
  terms, this corresponds to asking if these different zones process the stimulus
  properties in the same way.  Here, we propose a new framework that enables researchers
  to ask if the properties of a stimulus affect two brain zones in the same way. We
  use simulated data and two real fMRI datasets with complex naturalistic stimuli
  to show that our framework enables us to make such inferences. Our inferences are
  strikingly consistent between the two datasets, indicating that the proposed framework
  is a promising new tool for neuroscientists to understand how information is processed
  in the brain. '
