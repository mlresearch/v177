abstract: We consider the problem of causal structure learning in the setting of heterogeneous
  populations, i.e., populations in which a single causal structure does not adequately
  represent all population members, as is common in biological and social sciences.  To
  this end, we introduce a distance covariance-based kernel designed specifically
  to measure the similarity between the underlying nonlinear causal structures of
  different samples.  Indeed, we prove that the corresponding feature map is a statistically
  consistent estimator of nonlinear independence structure, rendering the kernel itself
  a statistical test for the hypothesis that sets of samples come from different generating
  causal structures.  Even stronger, we prove that the kernel space is isometric to
  the space of causal ancestral graphs, so that distance between samples in the kernel
  space is guaranteed to correspond to distance between their generating causal structures.  This
  kernel thus enables us to perform clustering to identify the homogeneous subpopulations,
  for which we can then learn causal structures using existing methods.  Though we
  focus on the theoretical aspects of the kernel, we also evaluate its performance
  on synthetic data and demonstrate its use on a real gene expression data set.
