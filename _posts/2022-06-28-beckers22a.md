abstract: 'Although standard Machine Learning models are optimized for making predictions
  about observations, more and more they are used for making predictions about the
  results of actions. An important goal of Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI)
  is to compensate for this mismatch by offering explanations about the predictions
  of an ML-model which ensure that they are reliably action-guiding. As action-guiding
  explanations are causal explanations, the literature on this topic is starting to
  embrace insights from the literature on causal models. Here I take a step further
  down this path by formally defining the causal notions of sufficient explanations
  and counterfactual explanations. I show how these notions relate to (and improve
  upon) existing work, and motivate their adequacy by illustrating how different explanations
  are action-guiding under different circumstances. Moreover, this work is the first
  to offer a formal definition of actual causation that is founded entirely in action-guiding
  explanations. Although the definitions are motivated by a focus on XAI, the analysis
  of causal explanation and actual causation applies in general. I also touch upon
  the significance of this work for fairness in AI by showing how actual causation
  can be used to improve the idea of path-specific counterfactual fairness. '
