abstract: Telling apart cause and effect is a fundamental problem across many science
  disciplines. However, the randomized controlled trial, which is the golden-standard
  solution for this, is not always physically feasible or ethical. Therefore, we can
  only rely on passively observational data in such cases, making the problem highly
  challenging. Inspired by the observation that the conditional distribution of effect
  given cause, also known as the causal mechanism, is typically invariant in shape,
  we aim to capture the mechanism through estimating the stability of the conditional
  distribution. In particular, based on the inverse of stability – the divergence
  – we propose Conditional Divergence based Causal Inference (CDCI), a novel algorithm
  for detecting causal direction in purely observational data. By doing this, we can
  relax multiple strict assumptions commonly adopted in the causal discovery literature,
  including functional form and noise model. The proposed approach is generic and
  applicable to arbitrary measures of distribution divergence. The effectiveness of
  our method is demonstrated on a variety of both synthetic and real data sets, which
  compares favorably with existing state-of-the-art methods.
