abstract: 'We consider the problem of discovering causal relations from independence
  constraints selection bias in addition to confounding is present. While the seminal
  FCI algorithm is sound and complete in this setup, no criterion for the causal interpretation
  of its output under selection bias is presently known. We focus instead on local
  patterns of independence relations, where we find no sound method for only three
  variable that can include background knowledge. Y-Structure patterns are shown to
  be sound in predicting causal relations from data under selection bias, where cycles
  may be present. We introduce a finite-sample scoring rule for Y-Structures that
  is shown to successfully predict causal relations in simulation experiments that
  include selection mechanisms. On real-world microarray data, we show that a Y-Structure
  variant performs well across different datasets, potentially circumventing spurious
  correlations due to selection bias. '
