abstract: 'Humans have a remarkable ability to disentangle complex sensory inputs
  (e.g., image, text) into simple factors of variation (e.g., shape, color) without
  much supervision. This ability has inspired many works that attempt to solve the
  following question: how do we invert the data generation process to extract those
  factors with minimal or no supervision? Several works in the literature on non-linear
  independent component analysis have established this negative result; without some
  knowledge of the data generation process or appropriate inductive biases, it is
  impossible to perform this inversion. In recent years, a lot of progress has been
  made on disentanglement under structural assumptions, e.g., when we have access
  to auxiliary information that makes the factors of variation conditionally independent.
  However, existing work requires a lot of auxiliary information, e.g., in supervised
  classification, it prescribes that the number of label classes should be at least
  equal to the total dimension of all factors of variation. In this work, we depart
  from these assumptions and ask: a) How can we get disentanglement when the auxiliary
  information does not provide conditional independence over the factors of variation?
  b) Can we reduce the amount of auxiliary information required for disentanglement?
  For a class of models where auxiliary information does not ensure conditional independence,
  we show theoretically and experimentally that disentanglement (to a large extent)
  is possible even when the auxiliary information dimension is much less than the
  dimension of the true latent representation.'
