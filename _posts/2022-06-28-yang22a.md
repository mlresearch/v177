abstract: Linear structural causal models (SCMs)– in which each observed variable
  is generated by a subset of the other observed variables as well as a subset of
  the exogenous sources– are pervasive in causal inference and casual discovery. However,
  for the task of causal discovery, existing work almost exclusively focus on the
  submodel where each observed variable is associated with a distinct source with
  non-zero variance. This results in the restriction that no observed variable can
  deterministically depend on other observed variables or latent confounders. In this
  paper, we extend the results on structure learning by focusing on a subclass of
  linear SCMs which do not have this property, i.e., models in which observed variables
  can be causally affected by any subset of the sources, and are allowed to be a deterministic
  function of other observed variables or latent confounders. This allows for a more
  realistic modeling of influence or information propagation in systems. We focus
  on the task of causal discovery form observational data generated from a member
  of this subclass. We derive a set of necessary and sufficient conditions for unique
  identifiability of the causal structure. To the best of our knowledge, this is the
  first work that gives identifiability results for causal discovery under both latent
  confounding and deterministic relationships. Further, we propose an algorithm for
  recovering the underlying causal structure when the aforementioned conditions are
  satisfied. We validate our theoretical results both on synthetic and real datasets.
