abstract: We introduce a variational inference model called VIM, for Variational Independent
  Modules, for sequential data that learns and infers latent representations as a
  set of objects and discovers modular causal mechanisms over these objects. These
  mechanisms - which we call modules - are independently parametrized, define the
  stochastic transitions of entities and are shared across entities.  At each time
  step, our model infers from a low-level input sequence a high-level sequence of
  categorical latent variables to select which transition modules to apply to which
  high-level object. We evaluate this model in video prediction tasks where the goal
  is to predict multi-modal future events given previous observations. We demonstrate
  empirically that VIM can model 2D visual sequences in an interpretable way and is
  able to identify the underlying dynamically instantiated mechanisms of the generation
  process.  We additionally show that the learnt modules can be composed at test time
  to generalize to out-of-distribution observations.
