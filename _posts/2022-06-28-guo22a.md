abstract: Causal inference from observational datasets often relies on measuring and
  adjusting for covariates. In practice, measurements of the covariates can often
  be noisy and/or biased, or only measurements of their proxies may be available.
  Directly adjusting for these imperfect measurements of the covariates can lead to
  biased causal estimates. Moreover, without additional assumptions, the causal effects
  are not point-identifiable due to the noise in these measurements. To this end,
  we study the partial identification of causal effects given noisy covariates, under
  a user-specified assumption on the noise level. The key observation is that we can
  formulate the identification of the average treatment effects (ATE) as a robust
  optimization problem. This formulation leads to an efficient robust optimization
  algorithm that bounds the ATE with noisy covariates. We show that this robust optimization
  approach can extend a wide range of causal adjustment methods to perform partial
  identification, including backdoor adjustment, inverse propensity score weighting,
  double machine learning, and front door adjustment. Across synthetic and real datasets,
  we find that this approach provides ATE bounds with a higher coverage probability
  than existing methods.
