abstract: Fairness of machine learning algorithms has been of increasing interest.
  In order to suppress or eliminate discrimination in prediction, various notions
  as well as approaches have been proposed to impose fairness. Given a notion of fairness,
  an essential problem is then whether or not it can always be attained, even if with
  an unlimited amount of data. This issue is, however, not well addressed yet. In
  this paper, focusing on the Equalized Odds notion of fairness, we consider the attainability
  of this criterion and, furthermore, if it is attainable, the optimality of the prediction
  performance under various settings. In particular, for prediction performed by a
  deterministic function of input features, we give conditions under which Equalized
  Odds can hold true; if the stochastic prediction is acceptable, we show that under
  mild assumptions, fair predictors can always be derived. For classification, we
  further prove that compared to enforcing fairness by post-processing, one can always
  benefit from exploiting all available features during training and get potentially
  better prediction performance while remaining fair. Moreover, while stochastic prediction
  can attain Equalized Odds with theoretical guarantees, we also discuss its limitation
  and potential negative social impacts.
