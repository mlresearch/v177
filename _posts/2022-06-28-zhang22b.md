abstract: 'We examine the role of textual data as study units when conducting causal
  inference by drawing parallels between human subjects and organized texts. We elaborate
  on key causal concepts and principles, and expose some ambiguity and sometimes fallacies.
  To facilitate better framing a causal query, we discuss two strategies: (i) shifting
  from immutable traits to perceptions of them, and (ii) shifting from some abstract
  concept/property to its constituent parts, i.e., a constructivist perspective of
  an abstract concept. We hope this article would raise the awareness of the importance
  of articulating and clarifying fundamental concepts before delving into developing
  methodologies when drawing causal inference using textual data.'
