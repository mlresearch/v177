abstract: 'The gold-standard approach to estimating heterogeneous treatment effects
  (HTEs) is randomized controlled trials (RCTs)/controlled experimental studies, where
  treatment randomization mitigates confounding biases. However, experimental data
  are usually small in sample size and limited in subjectsâ€™ diversity due to expensive
  costs. On the other hand, large observational studies (OSs) are becoming increasingly
  popular and accessible. However, OSs might be subject to hidden confounding whose
  existence is not testable. We develop an integrative $R$-learner for the HTE and
  confounding function by leveraging experimental data for identification and observational
  data for boosting efficiency. We form a regularized loss function for the HTE and
  confounding function that bears the Neyman orthogonality property, allowing flexible
  models for the nuisance function estimation. The key novelty of the proposed integrative
  $R$-learner is to impose different regularization terms for the HTE and confounding
  function so that the possible smoothness or sparsity of the confounding function
  can be leveraged to improve the HTE estimation. Our integrative $R$-learner has
  two benefits: first, it provides a general framework that can accommodate various
  HTE models for loss minimization; second, without any prior knowledge of hidden
  confounding in the OS, the proposed integrative $R$-learner is consistent and asymptotically
  at least as efficient as the estimator using only the RCT. The experiments based
  on extensive simulation and a real-data application adapted from an educational
  experiment show that the proposed integrative $R$-learner outperforms alternative
  approaches. '
