abstract: The potential outcome framework and structural causal model are two main
  frameworks for causal modeling, and there are efforts to combine the merits of each
  framework, such single world intervention graph (SWIG) and its potential outcome
  calculus.  In this paper, we propose the info intervention inspired by understanding
  as information transfer, and the corresponding causal calculus. On one hand, We
  explain its connection with do calculus; On the other hand, our info calculus has
  the same convenience of checking conditional independence as SWIG , and moreover
  owns a operator σ(·) for formalizing causal queries.
