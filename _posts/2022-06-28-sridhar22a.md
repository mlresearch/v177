abstract: 'We consider the problem of estimating social influence, the effect that
  a personâ€™s behavior has on the future behavior of their peers. The key challenge
  is that shared behavior between friends could be equally explained by influence
  or by two other confounding factors: 1) latent traits that caused people to both
  become friends and engage in the behavior, and 2) latent preferences for the behavior.  This
  paper addresses the challenges of estimating social influence with three contributions.  First,
  we formalize social influence as a causal effect, one which requires inferences
  about hypothetical interventions.  Second, we develop Poisson Influence Factorization
  (PIF), a method for estimating social influence from observational data.  PIF fits
  probabilistic factor models to networks and behavior data to infer variables that
  serve as substitutes for the confounding latent traits.  Third, we develop assumptions
  under which PIF recovers estimates of social influence.  We empirically study PIF
  with semi-synthetic and real data from Last.fm, and conduct a sensitivity analysis.  We
  find that PIF estimates social influence most accurately compared to related methods
  and remains robust under some violations of its assumptions.'
