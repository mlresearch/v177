abstract: Spurious correlations, or *shortcuts*, allow flexible models to predict
  well during training but poorly on related test populations. Recent work has shown
  that models that satisfy particular independencies involving the correlation-inducing
  *nuisance* variable have guarantees on their test performance. However, enforcing
  such independencies requires nuisances to be observed during training.  But nuisances
  such as demographics or image background labels are often missing. Enforcing independence
  on just the observed data does not imply independence on the entire population.
  In this work, we derive the missing-mmd estimator used for invariance objectives
  under missing nuisances. On simulations and clinical data, missing-mmds enable improvements
  in test performance similar to those achieved by using fully-observed data.
