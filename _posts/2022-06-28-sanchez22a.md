abstract: We consider the task of counterfactual estimation from observational imaging
  data given a known causal structure. In particular, quantifying the causal effect
  of interventions for high-dimensional data with neural networks remains an open
  challenge. Herein we propose Diff-SCM, a deep structural causal model that builds
  on recent advances of generative energy-based models. In our setting, inference
  is performed by iteratively sampling gradients of the marginal and conditional distributions
  entailed by the causal model. Counterfactual estimation is achieved by firstly inferring
  latent variables with deterministic forward diffusion, then intervening on a reverse
  diffusion process using the gradients of an anti-causal predictor w.r.t the input.
  Furthermore, we propose a metric for evaluating the generated counterfactuals. We
  find that Diff-SCM produces more realistic and minimal counterfactuals than baselines
  on MNIST data and can also be applied to ImageNet data. Code is available https://github.com/vios-s/Diff-SCM.
