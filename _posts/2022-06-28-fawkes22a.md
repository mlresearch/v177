abstract: In this paper we look at popular fairness methods that use causal counterfactuals.
  These methods capture the intuitive notion that a prediction is fair if it coincides
  with the prediction that would have been made if someoneâ€™s race, gender or religion
  were counterfactually different. In order to achieve this, we must have causal models
  that are able to capture what someone would be like if we were to counterfactually
  change these traits. However, we argue that any model that can do this must lie
  outside the particularly well behaved class that is commonly considered in the fairness
  literature. This is because in fairness settings, models in this class entail a
  particularly strong causal assumption, normally only seen in a randomised controlled
  trial. We argue that in general this is unlikely to hold. Furthermore, we show in
  many cases it can be explicitly rejected due to the fact that samples are selected
  from a wider population. We show this creates difficulties for counterfactual fairness
  as well as for the application of more general causal fairness methods.
