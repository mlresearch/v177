abstract: Among the most effective methods for uncovering high dimensional unstructured
  data’s generating mechanisms are techniques based on disentangling and learning
  independent causal mechanisms. However, to identify the disentangled model, previous
  methods need additional observable variables or do not provide identifiability results.
  In contrast, this work aims to design an identifiable generative model that approximates
  the underlying mechanisms from observational data using only self-supervision. Specifically,
  the generative model uses a degenerate mixture prior to learn mechanisms that generate
  or transform data. We outline sufficient conditions for an identifiable generative
  model up to three types of transformations that preserve a coarse-grained disentanglement.
  Moreover, we propose a self-supervised training method based on these identifiability
  conditions. We validate our approach on MNIST, FashionMNIST, and Sprites datasets,
  showing that the proposed method identifies disentangled models – by visualization
  and evaluating the downstream predictive model’s accuracy under environment shifts.
