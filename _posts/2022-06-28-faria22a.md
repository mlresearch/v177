abstract: 'Recent work has shown promising results in causal discovery by leveraging
  interventional data with gradient-based methods, even when the intervened variables
  are unknown. However, previous work assumes that the correspondence between samples
  and interventions is known, which is often unrealistic. We envision a scenario with
  an extensive dataset sampled from multiple intervention distributions and one observation
  distribution, but where we do not know which distribution originated each sample
  and how the intervention affected the system, \textit{i.e.}, interventions are entirely
  latent. We propose a method based on neural networks and variational inference that
  addresses this scenario by framing it as learning a shared causal graph among a
  infinite mixture (under a Dirichlet process prior) of intervention structural causal
  models . Experiments with synthetic and real data show that our approach and its
  semi-supervised variant are able to discover causal relations in this challenging
  scenario. '
