abstract: Conditional independence is often used as a testable implication of causal
  models of random variables. In addition, equality constraints have been proposed
  to distinguish between data-generating mechanisms. We show that one can also find
  equality constraints in linear Hawkes processes, extending this theory to a class
  of continuous-time stochastic processes. This is done by proving that Hawkes process
  models in a certain sense satisfy the equality constraints of linear structural
  equation models. These results allow more refined constraint-based structure learning
  in this class of processes. Arguing the existence of equality constraints leads
  us to new identification results for Hawkes processes. We also describe a causal
  interpretation of the linear Hawkes process which is closely related to its so-called
  cluster representation.
