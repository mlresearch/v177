abstract: Causal reasoning in relational domains is fundamental to studying real-world
  social phenomena in which individual units can influence each otherâ€™s traits and
  behavior. Dynamics between interconnected units can be represented as an instantiation
  of a relational causal model; however, causal reasoning over such instantiation
  requires additional templating assumptions that capture feedback loops of influence.
  Previous research has developed lifted representations to address the relational
  nature of such dynamics but has strictly required that the representation has no
  cycles. To facilitate cycles in relational representation and learning, we introduce
  relational $\sigma$-separation, a new criterion for understanding relational systems
  with feedback loops. We also introduce a new lifted representation, $\sigma$-\textit{abstract
  ground graph} which helps with abstracting statistical independence relations in
  all possible instantiations of the cyclic relational model. We show the necessary
  and sufficient conditions for the completeness of $\sigma$-AGG and that relational
  $\sigma$-separation is sound and complete in the presence of one or more cycles
  with arbitrary length. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work on representation
  of and reasoning with cyclic relational causal models.
