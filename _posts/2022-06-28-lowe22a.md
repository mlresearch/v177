abstract: On time-series data, most causal discovery methods fit a new model whenever
  they encounter samples from a new underlying causal graph. However, these samples
  often share relevant information which is lost when following this approach. Specifically,
  different samples may share the dynamics which describe the effects of their causal
  relations. We propose Amortized Causal Discovery, a novel framework that leverages
  such shared dynamics to learn to infer causal relations from time-series data. This
  enables us to train a single, amortized model that infers causal relations across
  samples with different underlying causal graphs, and thus leverages the shared dynamics
  information. We demonstrate experimentally that this approach, implemented as a
  variational model, leads to significant improvements in causal discovery performance,
  and show how it can be extended to perform well under added noise and hidden confounding.
