abstract: We introduce causal Markov Decision Processes (C-MDPs), a new formalism
  for sequential decision making which combines the standard MDP formulation with
  causal structures over state transition and reward functions. Many contemporary
  and emerging application areas such as digital healthcare and digital marketing
  can benefit from modeling with C-MDPs due to the causal mechanisms underlying the
  relationship between interventions and states/rewards. We propose the causal upper
  confidence bound value iteration (C-UCBVI) algorithm that exploits the causal structure
  in C-MDPs and improves the performance of standard reinforcement learning algorithms
  that do not take causal knowledge into account. We prove that C-UCBVI satisfies
  an $\tilde{O}(HS\sqrt{ZT})$ regret bound, where $T$ is the the total time steps,  $H$
  is  the episodic horizon, and $S$ is the cardinality of the state space. Notably,
  our regret bound does not scale with the size of actions/interventions ($A$), but
  only scales with a causal graph dependent quantity $Z$ which can be exponentially
  smaller than $A$. By extending C-UCBVI to the factored MDP setting, we propose the
  causal factored UCBVI (CF-UCBVI) algorithm, which further reduces the regret exponentially
  in terms of $S$. Furthermore, we show that RL algorithms for linear MDP problems
  can also be incorporated in C-MDPs. We empirically show the benefit of our causal
  approaches in various settings to validate our algorithms and theoretical results.
