abstract: 'In neoadjuvant trials on early-stage breast cancer, patients are usually
  randomized into a control group and a treatment group with an additional target
  therapy. Early efficacy of the new regimen is assessed via the binary pathological
  complete response (pCR) and the eventual efficacy is assessed via long-term clinical
  outcomes such as survival. Although pCR is strongly associated with survival, it
  has not been confirmed as a surrogate endpoint. To fully understand its clinical
  implication, it is important to establish causal estimands such as the causal effect
  in survival for patients who would achieve pCR under the new regimen. Under the
  principal stratification framework, previous studies focus on sensitivity analyses
  by varying model parameters in an imposed model on counterfactual outcomes. Under
  mild assumptions, we propose an approach to estimate those model parameters using
  empirical data and subsequently the causal estimand of interest. We also extend
  our approach to address censored outcome data. The proposed method is applied to
  a recent clinical trial and its performance is evaluated via simulation studies. '
