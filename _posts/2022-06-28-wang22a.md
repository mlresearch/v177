abstract: Kalisch and Bühlmann (2007) showed that for linear Gaussian models, under
  the Causal Markov Assumption, the Strong Causal Faithfulness Assumption, and the
  assumption of causal sufficiency, the PC algorithm is a uniformly consistent estimator
  of the Markov Equivalence Class of the true causal DAG for linear Gaussian models;
  it follows from this that for the identifiable causal effects in the Markov Equivalence
  Class, there are uniformly consistent estimators of causal effects as well. The
  $k$-Triangle-Faithfulness Assumption is a strictly weaker assumption that avoids
  some implausible implications of the Strong Causal Faithfulness Assumption and also
  allows for uniformly consistent estimates of Markov Equivalence Classes (in a weakened
  sense), and of identifiable causal effects. However, both of these assumptions are
  restricted to linear Gaussian models. We propose the Generalized $k$-Triangle Faithfulness,
  which can be applied to any smooth distribution. In addition, under the Generalized
  $k$-Triangle Faithfulness Assumption, we describe the Edge Estimation Algorithm
  that provides uniformly consistent estimators of causal effects in some cases (and
  otherwise outputs “can’t tell"), and the \textit{Very Conservative }$SGS$ Algorithm
  that (in a slightly weaker sense) is a uniformly consistent estimator of the Markov
  equivalence class of the true DAG.
