abstract: We develop a category-theoretic criterion for determining the equivalence
  of causal models having different but homomorphic directed acyclic graphs over discrete
  variables. Following Jacobs et al. (2019), we define a causal model as a probabilistic
  interpretation of a causal string diagram, i.e., a functor from the “syntactic”
  category Syn_G of graph $G$ to the category Stoch of finite sets and stochastic
  matrices. The equivalence of causal models is then defined in terms of a natural
  transformation or isomorphism between two such functors, which we call a $\Phi$-abstraction
  and $\Phi$-equivalence, respectively. It is shown that when one model is a $\Phi$-abstraction
  of another, the intervention calculus of the former can be consistently translated
  into that of the latter. We also identify the condition under which a model accommodates
  a $\Phi$-abstraction, when transformations are deterministic.
