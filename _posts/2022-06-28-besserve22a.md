abstract: Distinguishing between cause and effect using time series observational
  data is a major challenge in many scientific fields. A new perspective has been
  provided based on the principle of Independence of Causal Mechanisms (ICM), leading
  to the Spectral Independence Criterion (SIC) for time series causally unidirectionally
  linked by a linear time-invariant relation. SIC postulates that the power spectral
  density (PSD) of the cause time series is {\it uncorrelated} with the squared modulus
  of the frequency response of the filter generating the effect.  Since SIC rests
  on methods and assumptions in stark contrast with most causal discovery methods
  for time series, it raises questions regarding what theoretical grounds justify
  its use.  In this paper, we provide answers covering several key aspects. After
  providing an information theoretic interpretation of SIC, we present an identifiability
  result that sheds light on the context for which this approach is expected to perform
  well. We further demonstrate the robustness of SIC to downsampling – an obstacle
  that can spoil Granger-based inference.  Finally, an invariance perspective allows
  to explore the limitations of the spectral independence assumption and how to generalize
  it. Overall, these results provide insights on how the ICM principle can be assessed
  mathematically to infer direction of causation in empirical time series.
