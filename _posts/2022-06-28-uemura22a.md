abstract: 'Understanding causal relations of systems is a fundamental problem in science.
  The study of causal discovery aims to infer the underlying causal structure from
  uncontrolled observational samples. One major approach is to assume that causal
  structures follow structural equation models (SEMs), such as the additive noise
  model (ANM) and the post-nonlinear (PNL) model, and to identify these causal structures
  by estimating the SEMs. Although the PNL model is the most general SEM for causal
  discovery, its estimation method has not been well-developed except for the bivariate
  case. In this paper, we propose a new causal discovery method based on the multivariate
  PNL model. We extend the bivariate method to estimate multi-cause PNL models and
  combine it with the iterative sink search scheme used for the ANM. We apply the
  proposed method to synthetic and real-world causal discovery problems and show its
  effectiveness. '
