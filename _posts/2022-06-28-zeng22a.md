abstract: 'Discovery of causal relationships from observational data, especially from
  mixed data that consist of both continuous and discrete variables, is a fundamental
  yet challenging problem. Traditional methods focus on polishing the data type processing
  policy, which may lose data information. Compared with such methods, the constraint-based
  and score-based methods for mixed data derive certain conditional independence tests
  or score functions from the dataâ€™s characteristics. However, they may return the
  Markov equivalence class due to the lack of identifiability guarantees, which may
  limit their applicability or hinder their interpretability of causal graphs. Thus,
  in this paper, based on the structural causal models of continuous and discrete
  variables, we provide sufficient identifiability conditions in bivariate as well
  as multivariate cases. We show that if the data follow our proposed restricted Linear
  Mixed causal model (LiM), such a model is identifiable. In addition, we proposed
  a two-step hybrid method to discover the causal structure for mixed data. Experiments
  on both synthetic and real-world data empirically demonstrate the identifiability
  and efficacy of our proposed LiM model. '
