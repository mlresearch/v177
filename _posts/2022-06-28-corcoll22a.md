abstract: Exploration and credit assignment are still challenging problems for RL
  agents under sparse rewards. We argue that these challenges arise partly due to
  the intrinsic rigidity of operating at the level of actions. Actions can precisely
  define how to perform an activity but are ill-suited to describe what activity to
  perform. Instead, controlled effects describe transformations in the environment
  caused by the agent. These transformations are inherently composable and temporally
  abstract, making them ideal for descriptive tasks. This work introduces CEHRL, a
  hierarchical method leveraging the compositional nature of controlled effects to
  expedite the learning of task-specific behavior and aid exploration. Borrowing counterfactual
  and normality measures from causal literature, CEHRL learns an implicit hierarchy
  of transformations an agent can perform on the environment. This hierarchy allows
  a high-level policy to set temporally abstract goals and, by doing so, long-horizon
  credit assignment. Experimental results show that using effects instead of actions
  provides a more efficient exploration mechanism. Moreover, by leveraging prior knowledge
  in the hierarchy, CEHRL assigns credit to few effects instead of many actions and
  consequently learns tasks more rapidly.
