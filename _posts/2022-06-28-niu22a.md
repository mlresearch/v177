abstract: Estimating heterogeneous treatment effects in domains such as healthcare
  or social science often involves sensitive data where protecting privacy is important.
  We introduce a general meta-algorithm for estimating conditional average treatment
  effects (CATE) with differential privacy guarantees. Our meta-algorithm can work
  with simple, single-stage CATE estimators such as S-learner and more complex multi-stage
  estimators such as DR and R-learner. We perform a tight privacy analysis by taking
  advantage of sample splitting in our meta-algorithm and the parallel composition
  property of differential privacy. In this paper, we implement our approach using
  DP-EBMs as the base learner. DP-EBMs are interpretable, high-accuracy models with
  privacy guarantees, which allow us to directly observe the impact of DP noise on
  the learned causal model. Our experiments show that multi-stage CATE estimators
  incur larger accuracy loss than single-stage CATE or ATE estimators and that most
  of the accuracy loss from differential privacy is due to an increase in variance,
  not biased estimates of treatment effects.
