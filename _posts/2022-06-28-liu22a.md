abstract: " When using instrumental variables for causal inference, it is common practice
  to apply specific exclusion criteria to the data prior to estimation. This exclusion,
  critical for study design, is often done in an ad hoc manner, informed by a priori
  hypotheses and domain knowledge. In this study, we frame exclusion as a data-driven
  estimation problem, and apply flexible machine learning methods to estimate the
  probability of a unit complying with the instrument. We demonstrate how excluding
  likely noncompliers can increase power while maintaining valid treatment effect
  estimates. We show the utility of our approach with a fuzzy regression discontinuity
  analysis of the effect of initial diabetes diagnosis on follow-up blood sugar levels.
  Data-driven exclusion criterion can help improve both power and external validity
  for various quasi-experimental settings."
