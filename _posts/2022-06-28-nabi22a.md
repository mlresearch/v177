abstract: 'Recently there has been sustained interest in modifying prediction algorithms
  to satisfy fairness constraints. These constraints are typically complex nonlinear
  functionals of the observed data distribution. Focusing on the path-specific causal
  constraints, we introduce new theoretical results and optimization techniques to
  make model training easier and more accurate. Specifically, we show how to reparameterize
  the observed data likelihood such that fairness constraints correspond directly
  to parameters that appear in the likelihood, transforming a complex constrained
  optimization objective into a simple optimization problem with box constraints.
  We also exploit methods from empirical likelihood theory in statistics to improve
  predictive performance by constraining baseline covariates, without requiring parametric
  models. We combine the merits of both proposals to optimize a hybrid reparameterized
  likelihood. The techniques presented here should be applicable more broadly to fair
  prediction proposals that impose constraints on predictive models. '
