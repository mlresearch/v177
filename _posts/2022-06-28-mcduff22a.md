abstract: The ability to perform causal and counterfactual reasoning are central properties
  of human intelligence. Decision-making systems that can perform these types of reasoning
  have the potential to be more generalizable and interpretable. Simulations have
  helped advance the state-of-the-art in this domain, by providing the ability to
  systematically vary parameters (e.g., confounders) and generate examples of the
  outcomes in the case of counterfactual scenarios. However, simulating complex temporal
  causal events in multi-agent scenarios, such as those that exist in driving and
  vehicle navigation, is challenging. To help address this, we present a high-fidelity
  simulation environment that is designed for developing algorithms for causal discovery
  and counterfactual reasoning in the safety-critical context. A core component of
  our work is to introduce agency, such that it is simple to define and create complex
  scenarios using high-level definitions. The vehicles then operate with agency to
  complete these objectives, meaning low-level behaviors need only be controlled if
  necessary. We perform experiments with three state-of-the-art methods to create
  baselines and highlight the affordances of this environment. Finally, we highlight
  challenges and opportunities for future work.
